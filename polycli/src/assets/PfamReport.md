- [x] nomenclature coverage metric

Excluding 3j9m, 5x8t due to mitochondrial/chlro mapping
Excluding 4v7e due to low covereage of data on uniprot
Excluding 4v9f due to low covereage of data on uniprot
Excluding 5t2a due to low covereage of data on uniprot
Excluding 5xxb due to absence of data.



3j79 : j is el8, es12 and 6 is el8 es12
5t5h : Z,a uL24 group eats up a lot 


### Problematic families: 
- PF01248  (ex 3j79 chain 6) is mapped to both by eL8, eS12 and eL30
- PF00240 ubiquitin figures in both eS31 and eL40 proteins. Restricted to 40 for now.
